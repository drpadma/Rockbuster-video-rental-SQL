# Rockbuster Video Rental
I utilized PostgresSQL and RDBMS to access data from the Rockbuster database,
which houses video rentals.
By following the creation of an ERD (Entity relationship diagram), I then
performed various queries in Postgres using the SQL commands to filter the data,
performed a thorough analysis, joined different tables, and performed
subqueries/Common table expressions to pull out various information from
different tables and downloaded the data from Postgres as a CSV file for further
analysis
In the end, I prepared a presentation with all of my analytical insights for
enhancing sales after using Tableau to create visualizations.
The project brief, raw data, analysis, and other files are included in the above
attachments.
